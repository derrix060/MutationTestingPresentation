# Practical Mutation Test

This repository was create to show how mutation test works, and to discuss about when and how to use it.

Is it possible also comparing this approach with code coverage (more popular)

## Instructions

As it was written in Python3, it needs it installed. I will demonstrate the installation to a Linux Enviroment.

### Installing Python3

The first step is check if you have python3 installed, and if no, download it.

```bash
$ python3 --version
Python 3.X.X

# If this message appear, you need to install the python3
command not found: python3
$ sudo apt-get install python3

...

# Now you can check again the installation
$ python3 --version
Python 3.X.X
```
